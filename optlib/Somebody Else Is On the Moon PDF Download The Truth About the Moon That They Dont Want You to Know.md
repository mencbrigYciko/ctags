Some of the photographs that George H. Leonard used in his book were taken by the Lunar Orbiter and Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. These missions were part of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, and aimed to explore and map the moon for scientific and military purposes. However, Leonard claims that these missions also encountered and photographed evidence of alien activity on the moon, such as towers, bridges, domes, tracks, vehicles, and even humanoid figures . He also alleges that NASA altered or deleted some of these images before releasing them to the public or to other researchers .

Leonard's book has been controversial and criticized by many experts and skeptics. Some of the main criticisms are that Leonard's interpretations of the photographs are subjective and based on pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where people see patterns or shapes that are not really there. Others argue that Leonard's sources and methods are unreliable and unscientific, and that he did not provide enough evidence or references to support his claims. Some also point out that Leonard's book contains factual errors and inconsistencies, such as misidentifying lunar features or locations. Moreover, some critics accuse Leonard of being a hoaxer or a conspiracy theorist who wanted to make money or fame from his book.
 
Despite these criticisms, Leonard's book has also attracted some supporters and followers who believe that he was telling the truth and that he exposed a hidden reality on the moon. Some of these supporters are other researchers or authors who have written similar books or articles about alien structures on the moon or other planets. Others are enthusiasts or amateurs who have analyzed NASA photographs or videos and claimed to find anomalies or signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. Some of these supporters also believe that NASA and other governments or organizations are involved in a cover-up or a conspiracy to hide the truth about alien life from the public.
