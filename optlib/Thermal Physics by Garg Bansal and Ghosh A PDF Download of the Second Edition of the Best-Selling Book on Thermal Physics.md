The book was first published in 1992 and has since been revised and updated in its second edition in 2012. The book covers the basic concepts and principles of thermal physics, such as the zeroth, first, second and third laws of thermodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the equipartition theorem, the Carnot cycle, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the Gibbs free energy, the phase transitions, the blackbody radiation, the Planck's law, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the Wien's displacement law, the Bose-Einstein condensation, the Fermi-Dirac statistics and the quantum statistics of photons and phonons.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise language that is easy to understand for students. The book also features many solved examples, exercises, multiple choice questions and numerical problems that help students to test their understanding and practice their problem-solving skills. The book also includes appendices that provide useful mathematical tools and tables for reference.
 
The book is available in PDF format for free download from various online sources[^2^] [^3^]. However, it is recommended that students buy the original hard copy from Tata McGraw-Hill Education or Google Books[^1^] to support the authors and publishers.

*Thermal Physics* by Garg, Bansal and Ghosh is a great book for students who want to learn thermal physics in a rigorous and engaging way. It is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in physics and engineering.
  
In this article, we will review some of the main topics and concepts covered in the book *Thermal Physics* by Garg, Bansal and Ghosh.
 
## The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
 
The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This means that they have the same temperature. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a system. The zeroth law of thermodynamics allows us to define a temperature scale and compare the temperatures of different systems.
 
## The First Law of Thermodynamics
 
The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. This means that energy can be transferred between a system and its surroundings in the form of heat or work, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy principle.
 
## The Second Law of Thermodynamics
 
The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. The second law of thermodynamics implies that there is a directionality or irreversibility in natural processes. It also implies that there is a limit to how efficiently heat can be converted into work by a heat engine.
 
## The Third Law of Thermodynamics
 
The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a pure crystalline substance at absolute zero temperature is zero. This means that at absolute zero temperature, there is only one possible way to arrange the atoms or molecules in a perfect crystal, and hence there is no disorder or randomness. The third law of thermodynamics allows us to define an absolute scale of entropy and calculate the absolute entropies of substances.
